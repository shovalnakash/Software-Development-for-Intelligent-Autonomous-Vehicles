### Navigation in 5 days:

* The objective of this course is to give you the basic tools and knowledge to be able to understand and create any basic ROS Navigation related project. 
this course will give the ability to create maps of environments, localize the robot in the environment, make the robots perform path planning, visualize data of the different Navigation processes and debug errors using Rviz.
* The course will allow to understand Navigation packages that others have done. So, ROS code that made by others can be taken by you and after understanding it you can modify it for your own purposes.
* This course can serve as an introduction to be able to better understand the official ROS Navigation documentation or external Navigation documentation and projects.
